# data-science-pokemon-champions

This Jupyter Notebook is a portfolio for Data Science.<br>
I import a small dataset of pokemons and perform a series of operations to analyse, calculate and filter the best common pokemon based on the status contained in the dataset.<br>
<br>
The resulting team is in a .csv file
<br>
Virtual Environment Requirements are in the .txt file, but using only "Jupyter-Lab" and "Voila" should be enough.
<br><br>
The Pokemon Dataset used was obtained from https://github.com/KeithGalli/pandas
